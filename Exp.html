										<br />
										<b>The Solution:</b><br />
										Drawing on my technical expertise, I embarked on a project to automate 420 processes within our SailPoint and Data Loss Prevention (DLP) programs. Over the course of three weeks, I meticulously refined these processes, leading to a nearly threefold increase in throughput. The impact was immediate and profound—what once took hours of manual labor could now be accomplished with a few clicks, freeing up valuable time for the team to focus on more strategic tasks.
										<br />
										<b>Expanding the Horizon:</b><br />
										With the automation running smoothly, I turned my attention to our scanning operations. The security landscape was vast, with 80 new servers and 940 network shares awaiting integration into our scanning protocols. I expanded the scanning scope, diligently adding these assets, and in doing so, we achieved a 60% remediation rate for NTFS share vulnerabilities. This was a significant milestone, ensuring that potential risks were swiftly identified and addressed.
										<br />
										<b>Ensuring Compliance:</b><br />
										But it wasn't just about expanding our reach; it was about precision and coverage. I took on the responsibility of reconciling bi-weekly Azure and monthly on-premises server lists. This task was crucial—without it, we risked gaps in our scanning coverage, leaving our defenses vulnerable. By ensuring every endpoint was accounted for, I maintained our compliance with strict security protocols, closing the door on potential threats.
										<br />
										<b>Data Migration and Governance:</b><br />
										The task of managing classified data was another significant challenge. I spearheaded the migration of 96% of our classified shares, categorizing them for divisional evaluation. This was more than just a technical exercise—it was about prioritizing what mattered most for the Audit team and ensuring that our most sensitive information was under tight control.
										<br />
										<b>Enhancing Visibility:</b><br />
										Throughout my time at Abbott, I recognized the power of data-driven insights. To keep our senior leadership informed, I developed VBA-based source sheets and created 24 PowerBI dashboards. These dashboards became the go-to resource for real-time security reporting, allowing leaders to make informed decisions at a glance.
										<br />
										<b>Maintaining Integrity:</b><br />
										Not every scan ran perfectly the first time, and when failures occurred, I was on it. By analyzing logs and using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), I troubleshot and resolved issues, ensuring that our scanning efforts maintained their integrity and continued to protect our infrastructure.
										<br />
										<b>Guiding the Team:</b><br />
										Cybersecurity is as much about people as it is about technology. I provided guidance to internal stakeholders, helping them document over 40 procedures in line with data protection standards. This effort was vital in maintaining consistency and compliance across the board.
										<br />
										<b>Building a Culture of Security:</b><br />
										Understanding that security is everyone's responsibility, I played an active role in educating and training employees on compliance responsibilities. This initiative helped build a culture of security awareness throughout the organization.
										<br />
										<b>Collaboration at the Core:</b><br />
										Finally, I worked closely with various IT security departments, ensuring that our internal processes—whether through ServiceNow tickets, CMDB management, or change management activities—were seamless and effective. Collaboration was key, and by fostering strong relationships, we ensured that no security incident or request fell through the cracks.
										<br />
										<b>The Outcome:</b><br />
										My time at Abbott was a journey of transformation, where I took on complex challenges and delivered impactful solutions. I left behind a stronger, more resilient security framework, ready to face the evolving threats of tomorrow.
